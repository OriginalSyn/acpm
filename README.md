### acpm - Assetto Corsa Package Manager (0.0.1)

A (hopefully) simple way to help you manage your Assetto Corsa mods.

acpm is a little application that manages your Assetto Corsa packages (where a package is a plugin/mod/app/skin) and notifies you when the author releases an update.

Please exit Assetto Corsa before installing/updating any packages.

#### THIS IS A PROTYPE!
I threw this together in a few hours. I didn't want to spend too much time on it mainly because I wanted to see how well this would be recieved. I can easily see why developers would rather drive traffic to their site to download their mods. 

Don't judge me too harshly on my code - again PROTOTYPE.

Since this is a prototype, it should only be used by more experienced users.

#### Known Limitations
Since this is a prototype, it doesn't do a lot of things it probably should. Known limitations:
- This application will only assume the Assetto Corsa is installed in the default c:\program files(blah blah bla)\assettocoresa for steam installs in either program files or program files x86. It should, however, find Assetto Corsa in either of those locations. 
- No uninstall of packages.
- Updating packages overwrites any file that is in the zip. Not sure how that will play out.
